# movie_data_generator_Api.ipynb
This Python script prompts the user to enter a movie title, fetches movie details from the OMDB API with error handling for network issues, extracts key information like title, year, and director, saves this data in a JSON-formatted text file, and then reads and displays the stored information, handling potential file errors gracefully.
